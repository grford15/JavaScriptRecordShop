# JavaScriptRecordShop

# Good news/bad news, G6! 

Stevie is following his dream and starting that record store he's always talking about! 

Unfortunately, he's too busy with architects, planning permissions and the like to sit down and make all the code he's going to need! _But that's where you come in!_

Your task is to use JS TDD to model Stevie's Record Store 

## MVP

## Part A

- Create a Record object that has an Artist, Title, Genre, and Price
- Create a Record Store that has a Name, City and an Inventory.
- Give the Record Store a Balance. 
- Add some Records to the Store's Inventory.

## Part B

- Create a method that prints out the Record's properties as a string.
- Create a method that lists the Record Shop's inventory - ie implements the above method on every record in the shop.
- Create a method so the Record Store can sell a Record and adjusts the Store's balance to account for the Record being sold.
- Create a method that reports the financial situation of the Store, showing the balance and value of inventory.
- Create a method that allows the store to view all Records of a given Genre.

## Part C

- Create a RecordCollector (or Customer) constructor who can buy and sell records.
- The RecordCollector should have cash that increase and decreases with buying and selling.
- The RecordCollector shouldn't be able to buy a Record if he can't afford it.
- The RecordCollector should be able to view the total value of their collection
- The RecordCollector should be able to view the total value of all records of a given Genre
- The RecordCollector should be able to view their most valuable record.
- The RecordCollector should be able to sort their records by value. (ascending or descending)
- The RecordCollector should be able to compare the value of their collection with another RecordCollector


## Extension

- If you haven't already: refactor your code to use enumeration throughout.
